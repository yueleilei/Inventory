- future steps include 
- PCB modules like Caps and DPAK and TO220 combos
- automate PDF creation
- automate zip file creation
- QUCS resimulate with 2k instead of 70R, can't seem to get it to work stable over 100R. I'm sure it will work stable in real life.
- LED's to ouput drivers, perhaps RPM input signal as well
- add footprints to symbols
- correct signal paths for CPU board, (done mostly at PCB layout)
- add vendor numbers to field1 or field?
- correct "Xk"'s and "C"'s from BOM, (figure out what those values should be, and replace the Xk's and C's with the right value)

This log it a reminder for me to remember what to work on. I seem to get on something then forget the other parts, so I'll try to remember to place items to work on here, then some day they will be removed from here, and found under the changes log.

Note to self or anyone that uses windows to remove the /n/r from a windows edited file, use dos2unix inputfile outputfile.
